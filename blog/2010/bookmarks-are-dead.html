          <h1 class="title">Bookmarks Are Dead</h1>

      <p>At least to me.  I noticed the other day that I almost never use bookmarks anymore.  A year or two ago I was a bookmark junky, having 500+ easily.  So what changed?  In reflecting upon it, I think there are a few reasons for this…</p>

<ul>
<li>I switched to using Chrome whenever I’m not doing web development (Firebug is just too awesome to give up).  The way Chrome is designed the bookmarks aren’t exactly a prime, in-your-face feature which are easily accessible — at least not in the way Firefox and Internet Explorer implement it.</li>
<li>I use Twitter much more than I did in past years.  A lot (and by lot I’d say 50% at least) of the new sites I visit are from links seen on Twitter.  I follow people who tweet about topics I’m interested in (@smashingmag, @sixrevisions, @activestate, @cssbeauty, @usejquery) and thus click a lot of links that are posted.</li>
<li>Instead of “surfing the web” looking for new sites, as was all the rage in the 90’s, I tend to frequent the same sites, often times which serve in some part as content aggregation — and I already know their address.  Why do I need to bookmark it?</li>
<li>Chrome Pinned Tabs — Sites I really frequent have a permanent Chrome tab to keep them open.</li>
<li>Chrome Address Bar — Why waste the time to find a bookmark when you can just type something relatively close to what you want into the address bar and get instant results?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Why are 3 of the 5 related to Chrome?  Google conspiracy theories ignite…)</em></p>

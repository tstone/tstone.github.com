          <h1 class="title">Introducing Microwave.JS</h1>

      <p>This blog post is a bit recursive.  Last weekend I built a new blog platform, and this post is the first <em>new</em> post
being written on it.  Actually, it&#39;s not being written on it at all.  It&#39;s being written in Komodo Edit, which is the
point of the platform.</p>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to have a reputation at work for oft referring to the principle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">Worse is Better</a>.
Blog editors are an exellent example of this.  Almost every blog platform has a huge amount of javascript which is responsible
for a very complex and intelligent WYSIWYG editor that most authors write their posts in.</p>

<p>The problem is this editor also usually doubles as the worst place to write code, ever.  Often times as I&#39;m composing a blog post,
I write the code in the blog, not in an editor first.  The simplest things like tab fail to be available, and always space&#39;bar&#39;ing it up
for things is annoying, especially anything beyond 1 level deep.</p>

<p>Microwave.js was born out of the Worse is Better mantra in that it has no editor.  In fact, it has no admin interface.  It doesn&#39;t even
have a database.  All it has are disk files.</p>

<p>Why?  None of that is needed.</p>

<p>The project is written in node.js, and there&#39;s a lot more documentation about the specifics of installing and configuring it on the
<a href="https://github.com/tstone/MicrowaveJS">github page</a>.</p>

<p>Microwave.js has a clear target in mind for users: developers.  The low-level approach should appeal to many, and the automatic syntax highlighting
is something I&#39;ve been wanting for so long in a blog editor.</p>

<p>And oh yeah, my blog lives at my new domain now, <a href="http://www.typeof.co">typeof.co</a>!</p>
